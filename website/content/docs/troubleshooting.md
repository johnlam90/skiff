Common issues, with fixes.

## Right-click does nothing

You're probably in macOS Terminal + tmux. Apple's default Terminal eats Button3 events before tmux can forward them, so Skiff never sees the right-click.

**Fix.** Use the `≡` icon in the top-left or double-tap `Esc` to open the action menu. Every right-click action also lives there. Long-term: switch to iTerm2, WezTerm, or Ghostty, which all forward Button3 correctly.

## Clipboard isn't working over SSH

OSC 52 is the mechanism. Most terminal emulators ship with OSC 52 writes disabled by default for security reasons. You have to opt in.

**iTerm2.** Settings → General → Selection → "Applications in terminal may access clipboard."

**Kitty.** Add `clipboard_control write-clipboard write-primary` to `kitty.conf`.

**WezTerm.** OSC 52 is on by default; check your `.wezterm.lua` doesn't have `enable_csi_u_key_encoding` blocking it.

**Ghostty.** Settings → "OSC 52 clipboard write" → Allow.

**tmux.** Run `tmux show-options -g set-clipboard`. If it's `off`, run `tmux set-option -g set-clipboard on` (default since tmux 3.2). Skiff also wraps OSC 52 in tmux passthrough automatically when `$TMUX` is set, so this should mostly be a non-issue.

## OSC 52 isn't pasting into my local app

Even if Skiff copies successfully, your *local* terminal has to be allowed to write to the system clipboard. Check the same setting above. Some corporate Macs disable clipboard access entirely via MDM; if `pbpaste` doesn't return your last copy, the issue is upstream of Skiff.

## Indexing is slow

The fuzzy file finder uses `git ls-files` for git repos (~150 ms on 50,000 files) and falls back to a `filepath.Walk` on non-git projects.

**Slow on a git repo?** That's unusual. Run `git ls-files | wc -l` — if it's huge, see if you have committed `node_modules` or `vendor` directories that should be in `.gitignore`.

**Slow on a non-git project?** Check your `.gitignore`. Skiff reads it during the walk and skips anything that matches. Add `node_modules`, `dist`, `build`, `.cache`, and any other large generated directories. The hardcoded ignore list catches the most common offenders, but a `.gitignore` is the canonical signal.

## `Ctrl+S` froze my terminal

That's XOFF — a real terminal flow-control signal. Press `Ctrl+Q` to release it (XON). Skiff doesn't bind `Ctrl+S` for exactly this reason. Save with `Esc s` instead.

## Format on save isn't running

Three things to check:

1. Is `.skiff/format.json` in your project root? Skiff looks for it relative to the project root, not the file being saved.
2. Does the file's extension match a key in `commands`? Keys are extensions *without* the leading dot.
3. Did you trust the config? On the first save with a new or edited config, Skiff prompts. If you said No, every save in this project is a no-op until the config changes.

If the configured binary isn't installed, Skiff silently does nothing on save — that's deliberate, so you don't have to install everyone's formatter to clone a repo. To debug, run the formatter command manually and confirm it works.

## Files I just created don't show up in the finder

The finder index refreshes every 10 seconds and immediately after any create / rename / delete *inside* Skiff. If you create a file from another shell pane, wait up to 10 seconds, then reopen the finder.

## My terminal's color is off

Skiff's palettes are authored in 24-bit color. Most modern terminals support it; some older ones default to 256-color mode. Check `tput colors` — anything less than `16777216` means truecolor isn't on. Set `COLORTERM=truecolor` in your shell rc and reconnect, and if you run tmux, start it with `tmux -2`.

Below 256 colors Skiff stops relying on hue and switches to an attribute-based palette instead: reverse video for the selection and the status bar, bold for the active tab and dirty markers, underline for the current find match. That is deliberate, not a broken theme — on a 16-color `TERM` every gray in a theme collapses onto the same ANSI "bright black", so a color-only cue would be invisible. If the editor looks unexpectedly monochrome, `tput colors` is the thing to check.

## The image preview is blocky

Image preview uses the half-block technique — every cell is `▀` with a top color and a bottom color, giving you two vertical pixels per character cell. That's the trade for a renderer that works in *every* truecolor-capable terminal (including macOS Terminal) and passes through tmux without any passthrough config. For pixel-perfect previews, open the file on your laptop with a custom action.

## I want to see what `Esc t` does

The whole leader table is in the [Hotkeys](/docs/hotkeys/) doc. The action menu also shows the bound combo next to each item, so you can learn the table by using the menu first.
