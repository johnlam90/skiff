Skiff is mouse-first. Every UI surface is clickable, draggable, or scrollable. This page is the complete reference.

## Editor body

| Gesture                                | Effect                                                                 |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Left-click                             | Place the cursor at the click point.                                   |
| Left-click + drag                      | Extend a selection from the press point.                               |
| Drag past the top or bottom edge       | Auto-scroll while extending the selection at your last column.         |
| Double-click                           | Select the word under the cursor (`[A-Za-z0-9_]` definition).          |
| Scroll wheel                           | Scroll three lines per tick.                                           |
| Right-click                            | Open the action menu (in terminals that forward Button3).              |

## File tree

| Gesture                                | Effect                                                                 |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Left-click on a folder                 | Toggle expand / collapse. Sets the folder as the active folder.        |
| Left-click on a file                   | Open the file in a new or existing tab.                                |
| Right-click on a folder                | Per-folder context menu: New File, Rename, Delete, Copy paths.         |
| Right-click on a file                  | Per-file context menu: Rename, Delete, Copy relative path, Copy absolute. |
| Scroll wheel                           | Scroll the tree.                                                       |

The active folder — the one shown bold in the sidebar — is the default target for New File. The label in the action menu reflects this: "New file in `cmd/`" when a subfolder is active, plain "New file" at the project root.

Note: macOS Terminal + tmux often swallows Button3. Every right-click action also lives in the main `≡` menu, so you're never stuck.

## Tab bar

| Gesture                                | Effect                                                                 |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Left-click a tab body                  | Switch to that tab.                                                    |
| Left-click the `×` on a tab            | Close that tab. Dirty tabs prompt Save / Discard / Cancel.             |
| Left-click the `≡` icon                | Open the action menu.                                                  |

## Splitter

The single column between the sidebar and the editor is the splitter.

| Gesture                                | Effect                                                                 |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Press on the splitter column, drag     | Resize the sidebar. Min sidebar width: 18. Min editor width: 40.       |

## Modals (action menu, find, finder, confirms)

| Gesture                                | Effect                                                                 |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Left-click a row                       | Activate the row's action.                                             |
| Hover                                  | Highlight the row under the cursor.                                    |
| Click outside the modal                | Dismiss.                                                               |

## Status bar

The status bar shows the active file's path, language, cursor position, dirty marker, git branch and change count (when applicable), and any flash messages from background work. One region is clickable: the branch segment on the right flips the sidebar to the GIT panel — the mouse-first sibling of `Esc g`. The sidebar's own header is clickable too: the `EXPLORER` and `GIT` tabs switch between the file tree and the uncommitted-changes list, and clicking a change row opens its diff — side-by-side on wide terminals, unified on narrow ones — with an `[ Open file ]` button that jumps to the first changed line.
